This project is an automated testing project that utilizes [WebdriverIO](https://webdriver.io/) (WDIO) and [Axe](https://www.deque.com/axe/core-documentation/) to test the accessibility of a web page. The purpose of this framework is to analyze the accessibility of a web page and output the results to an HTML report.
