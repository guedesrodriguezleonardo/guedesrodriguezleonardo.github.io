This project is an automated testing project that utilizes [WebdriverIO](https://webdriver.io/) (WDIO) to test the search functionality of the [MercadoLibre](https://www.mercadolibre.com.uy/) website. The purpose of this test is to retrieve the names, prices, and links of the articles found on the first 3 pages and output them into a .txt file.
