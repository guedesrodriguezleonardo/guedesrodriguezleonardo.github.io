Hello! I'm Leonardo Guedes, and I specialize in QA Automation, having completed my Specialization Degree at [Centro de Ensayos de Software](https://www.ces.com.uy) (2022-2023). Additionally, I hold a Technical Degree in Software Testing from JaP, acquired in 2020.

I'm dedicated to staying updated on the latest advancements and best practices in QA and automation. Continuously seeking out new tools, techniques, and methodologies is crucial for enhancing my skills and knowledge in this domain.

From roles as a QA Automation Engineer to Testing Strategy Lead, I've led automation initiatives, coordinated Agile team tasks, and integrated automated tests into CI/CD workflows.

Here is a list of the technologies that I'm familiar with!
